# Project: Custom Chatbot using Generative AI with Intel's 4th Generation Xeon Scalable Processors (PS 4)

## Problem Statement
The objective is to create a custom chatbot using Generative AI (GenAI) with a focus on fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLM) on Intel's 4th Generation Xeon Scalable processors. This project will demonstrate the integration of advanced AI tools to develop a domain-specific chatbot leveraging the Alpaca dataset from Stanford University.

## Solution Overview
We aim to simplify the process of creating a high-performance domain-specific chatbot by utilizing Intel’s AI software tools and hardware. The solution involves:
- Performing simple LLM inference on CPU
- Fine-tuning LLM models for specific domains
- Optimizing the chatbot’s performance using Intel's AI extensions


## Technologies Used
### Software and Tools
- **Python**: Programming language for model development.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: Library for accessing pre-trained LLMs.
- **Intel AI Extensions**: Tools for optimizing AI models on Intel hardware.
- **Scikit-learn**: For data preprocessing and initial analysis.

### Hardware
- **Intel 4th Generation Xeon Scalable Processors**: For efficient model inference and fine-tuning.
